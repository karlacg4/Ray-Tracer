# Ray-Tracer
Java program that calculates reflection, refraction, lights and shadows to create renders with Blinn Phong material.

## Usage

To use this project download the files and open the folder into and IDE.

In the ``objs`` folder are a few .OBJ files but you can add as many as you want.
On the class ``Scene.java`` you can add the objects and lights you want for your render.

The pdf file ``KarlaCarpinteyro_report.pdf`` explains some of the theory I used for this project including formulas.

On the folder ``Example renders`` are a few renders I created where you can see some ideas and how the reflection and refraction really worked out.
